# Circus_of_Plates
A Java Circus game using OOP concepts and design patterns.
###
How the game works:
###
-The game has three levels(each differ in the speed of the falling objects). 
###
-You use the left and right arrows to move the clown to catch falling objects using the clown's hand.
###
-When you start the game, you are given 3 lives. 
###
-If you catch a Bomb , one life is lost.
###
-If you catch a Skittle, one life is added.
###
-You increase the score by stacking 3 plates of the same colour on the same hand.
###
-There is also a Timer so the game ends in 1 min.
###
Design Patterns Used:
Stratetgy 
-Iterator
-State
-Factory
-Singleton
-Builder

Note: The bomb sound was uploaded successfully but the Circus Theme Sound was too big to be uploaded. Feel free to contact me for the sound I used or use your own .WAV sound file but change the path in the code for it to work.
