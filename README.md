# Circus_of_Plates
A Java Circus game using OOP concepts and design patterns.
How the game works:
-The game has three levels(each differ in the speed of the falling objects). 
-When you start the game, you are given 3 lives. 
-If you catch a Bomb , one life is lost.
-If you catch a Skittle, one life is added.
-You increase the score by stacking 3 plates of the same colour on the same hand.
-There is also a Timer so the game ends in 1 min.
